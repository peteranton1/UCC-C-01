Virtual Machine in C++
-------------

Implement a virtual stack machine in C++.

This implementation takes machine code instructions and data and runs those instructions and presents output on screen. 

This simulates the low level behaviour of a simple stack machine. This is useful for understanding stack machines. 

## How to Run

    make
    ./stack-vm
